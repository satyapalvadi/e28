*Answer the following questions in regards to the student's project you are reviewing. Include context and code examples in your answers when relevant.*


### Are you able to produce any errors or unexpected results?
No

### Were there any parts of the interface that you found confusing or unclear?
+ When I first looked at the App, it was little confusing regarding the purpose of the App. Once I read the "About" section in the "Tips" 
sidebar, the purpose of the App is clear. May be, consider adding the "About" section in a more prominent way in the App? 
Really liked the idea.

+ Once we load the demo, there is no real easy way to start a graph from scratch as there is no way to delete levels or nodes.

+ Refreshing the app doesn't work unless present at the root URL

### Are there aspects of the code that you feel were not self-evident and would benefit from comments?
+ Yes, I felt the code needs some comments as the App is a bit complicated.

### Are there any parts of the code that you found interesting or taught you something new?
+ Using material design

### Are there any best practices discussed in course material that you feel were not addressed in the code?
+ Didn't find any deviations from the course material

### Do you have any additional comments not covered in the above questions?
+ For P4, please consider adding delete options for levels and nodes.
